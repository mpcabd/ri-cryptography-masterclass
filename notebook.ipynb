Let's put it in a table:\n",

You lay down the small disc on top of the large disc, and rotate the smaller disc a number of letters, we can that the rotation, with that you get a mapping from one letter to another that you use to encrypt and decrypt. Here's an example:\n",

    "The Enigma was an encryption machine, and in its simplest form it could have more than 15 billion billion different configurations. That number looks like this $15,000,000,000,000,000,000$ or $15 \\times 10^{18}$. So when you want to break the code of the enigma, you have to spend years trying different combinations of its configurations to break it, and that's why the Nazis loved it, as no one had years to decrypt it, expecially that they changed the configuration daily, which means anyone who is able to decrypt a message and get to the configuration used had a maximum of 24 hours of use for that configuration. There were no computers back then, and all code breaking happened manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enigma was fitted with three wheels, we call them rotors, a reflector, and a plugboard. There were 26 different rotors you could choose from to fit in the machine, and you could change the wiring inside the reflector, and inside the plugboard, giving you that huge number of configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you press a key on its keyboard, an electric signal travels from that key, to the plugboard, where the key gets mapped to a different key depending on how the plugboard is wired, then the signal reaches the first rotor, were the key gets mapped again, then the second, then the third rotor, then the reflector, then back to the third, second, and first rotor. All this time the key was being remapped repeatedly, and at the end of the cycle the signal reaches the lightboard where the final mapped key would light up, and the rotors would rotate, which changes the mapping of the key to a different key. So for example, if you press T, and G lights up, pressing T again wouldn't necessarily mean that G would light up again, it could be any other key.\n",

Without such encryption, any person with access to the network between your device and the machine this document is running on would be able to read the data you and the page interchange.

    "RSA is a public-key cryptosystem, widely used on the Web and in other applications to encrypt messages in a hard-to-almost-impossible-to-break way. It uses a lot of smart maths on the inside, if you're interested in knowing how it works internally you can watch [this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7kEpw1tn50).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short though, let us see what RSA means.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RSA, and in public-key ciphers in general, we have what we call a cryptosystem, which is basically a pair of keys, and an alogirthm that uses these keys to encrypt and decrypt messags. The pair of keys are called the public key, and the private key. The public key is, obviously, public, and known to anyone who you interact with. The private key, on the other hand, is private, and must only be known to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public keys are used to encrypt messages, so anyone can encrypt a message using your public key and send you the message. Private keys are used to decrypt the messages, so only you can decrypt the message sent to you. The reason that only you can do that is that the math involved to try to guess your private key takes supercomputers years to solve, so you can rest assured no one can guess your private key if you've taken good care of keeping it a secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public keys have two numbers, $e$ and $n$, and private keys have three additional numbers $d$, $p$ and $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, and are really really large prime numbers, they're distinct primes, so $p \\neq q$ and they should be chosen to not be very close primes so usually they differ in length of digits.\n",
    "- $n$ is actually the product of $p$ and $q$, so $n = p \\times q$.\n",
    "- $d$ and $e$ are generated using mathmatical forumlas that are outside the scope of this intro.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to keep in mind is that $n$ and $e$ are public while $p$, $q$ and $d$ are private, and due to (1) the complex maths used to generate $e$ and (2) that factoring $n$ into $p$ and $q$ is really slow even on super computers, due to all that it's nearly impossible to break RSA, and that's why it's used on the Web. **It would take a classical computer around 300 trillion years to break a RSA-2048 bit encryption key, that's $300,000,000,000,000$ years or $300 \\times 10^{12}$ years.**\n",

    "\n",
    "When accessing websites, you'd usually notice the URL (Unique Resource Locator) starts with `https`, which is a secure version of `http`. HTTPS uses plenty of methods of encryption to secure your connection to the website you're viewing. RSA fails to be a good method for encrypting web pages, as the content of the web page is much larger usually than the block size in RSA, and using a block size suitable for large web pages means encryption and decryption will be extremely slow. So instead, computers use a faster simpler encryption method, for example AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), to encrypt the web page, and use RSA to encrypt the AES key. This way the AES key, which is not larger than what RSA supports, is secured really well, and your connection is safe."
