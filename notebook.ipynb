Cipher is the noun, encrypt is the verb, but many people use them quite interchangebly, so you can say encryption and ciphering ü§∑."

    "In block cipher, we write our message in a table, we put each letter in a cell, row by row, starting from the top left cell and finishing on the bottom right cell. The dimensions of the table differ by message. After that, we read the message column by column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a real example. Let's take the message **Hello world! This is RI masterclass**. This Cipher doesn't work well with spaces, so we remove all spaces and make each word start with a capital letter, so our message becomes **HelloWorld!ThisIsRiMasterclass**. Let's put it in a table:\n",

    "### 2. Sliding Scale Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "This cipher is very old, Julius Caesar used it to encrypt messages to his officers. The idea is pretty neat, you basically put the letters on two discs, one larger than the other. You lay down the small disc on top of the large disc, and rotate the smaller disc a number of letters, we can that the rotation, with that you get a mapping from one letter to another that you use to encrypt and decrypt. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;\"><img src=\"caesar.svg\" alt=\"rot4 cipher\" width=\"300px\"><br><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Here you see rot4 cipher, where each letter is mapped to the 4th next letter.</span></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see above, we use the notation of rot**Z** to refer to the cipher where **Z** is how many letters we've rotated the inner disc. Rot13 is a special one, in which the disc is rotated 13 places, which is half the letters, it's sometimes called the _half-reversed alphabet cipher_.\n",
