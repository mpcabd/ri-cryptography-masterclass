    "In this section, we're going to explore different methods of cryptography, we call them ciphers, which are bascially algorithms that if we follow we encrypt a message. Cipher is the noun, encrypt is the verb, but many people use them quite interchangebly, so you can say encryption and ciphering ü§∑."

    "In block cipher, we write our message in a table, we put each letter in a cell, row by row, starting from the top left cell and finishing on the bottom right cell. The dimensions of the table differ by message. After that, we read the message column by column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a real example. Let's take the message **Hello world! This is RI masterclass**. This Cipher doesn't work well with spaces, so we remove all spaces and make each word start with a capital letter, so our message becomes **HelloWorld!ThisIsRiMasterclass**. Let's put it in a table:\n",
