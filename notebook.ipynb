This Cipher doesn't work well with spaces, so we remove all spaces and make each word start with a capital letter, so our message becomes **HelloWorld!ThisIsRiMasterclass**. Let's put it in a table:\n",

    "This cipher is very old, Julius Caesar used it to encrypt messages to his officers. The idea is pretty neat, you basically put the letters on two discs, one larger than the other. You lay down the small disc on top of the large disc, and rotate the smaller disc a number of letters, we can that the rotation, with that you get a mapping from one letter to another that you use to encrypt and decrypt. Here's an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "As you see above, we use the notation of rot**Z** to refer to the cipher where **Z** is how many letters we've rotated the inner disc. Rot13 is a special one, in which the disc is rotated 13 places, which is half the letters, it's sometimes called the _half-reversed alphabet cipher_.\n",

    "The Enigma was an encryption machine, and in its simplest form it could have more than 15 billion billion different configurations. That number looks like this **15,000,000,000,000,000,000 or $15*10^{18}$**. So when you want to break the code of the enigma, you have to spend years trying different combinations of its configurations to break it, and that's why the Nazis loved it, as no one had years to decrypt it, expecially that they changed the configuration daily, which means anyone who is able to decrypt a message and get to the configuration used had a maximum of 24 hours of use for that configuration. There were no computers back then, and all code breaking happened manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enigma was fitted with three wheels, we call them rotors, a reflector, and a plugboard. There were 26 different rotors you could choose from to fit in the machine, and you could change the wiring inside the reflector, and inside the plugboard, giving you that huge number of configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you press a key on its keyboard, an electric signal travels from that key, to the plugboard, where the key gets mapped to a different key depending on how the plugboard is wired, then the signal reaches the first rotor, were the key gets mapped again, then the second, then the third rotor, then the reflector, then back to the third, second, and first rotor. All this time the key was being remapped repeatedly, and at the end of the cycle the signal reaches the lightboard where the final mapped key would light up, and the rotors would rotate, which changes the mapping of the key to a different key. So for example, if you press T, and G lights up, pressing T again wouldn't necessarily mean that G would light up again, it could be any other key.\n",
